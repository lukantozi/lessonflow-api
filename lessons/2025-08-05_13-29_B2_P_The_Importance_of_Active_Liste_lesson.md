## Reading Material 1 – The Importance of Active Listening in Personal Relationships

(1)  
Active listening is a crucial skill for building strong personal relationships. It involves fully concentrating, understanding, and responding to what the other person is communicating. Unlike passive hearing, active listening requires effort and attention. When people feel genuinely heard, they are more likely to trust and connect with you. This trust forms the foundation of any meaningful relationship, whether with family, friends, or partners.

(2)  
To practice active listening, one needs to focus on the speaker without distractions. This means putting away smartphones and avoiding interrupting when someone is speaking. Eye contact and nodding can encourage the speaker to continue, as they signal that you are engaged. By asking clarifying questions, you demonstrate that you are interested in understanding their perspective. This can lead to deeper conversations and a stronger bond.

(3)  
Reflecting on what the speaker has said is another important aspect of active listening. This involves paraphrasing or summarizing their points to show that you have comprehended their message. For example, saying, "So, you feel..." can confirm your understanding and give the speaker a chance to clarify any misunderstandings. This practice not only helps in avoiding conflicts but also strengthens empathy and mutual respect.

(4)  
Active listening is particularly beneficial in resolving conflicts. When disagreements arise, listening attentively to each person's viewpoint can lead to more productive discussions. It allows individuals to express their emotions and concerns without fear of judgment. By focusing on the speaker's words rather than planning your response, you can address the root of the issue more effectively and find a mutually agreeable solution.

(5)  
Despite its importance, active listening is often overlooked in our fast-paced world. People are frequently preoccupied with their thoughts or multitasking, which hinders true communication. However, by making a conscious effort to listen actively, we can improve our personal relationships significantly. This skill not only enhances understanding but also creates an environment where everyone feels valued and respected.

## Reading Material 2 – Renewable Ocean Energy as a Future Power Source

(1)  
Renewable ocean energy is emerging as a promising alternative power source. With the world's growing energy demands, it's crucial to find sustainable solutions. Ocean energy harnesses the power of tides, waves, and thermal gradients. These sources are abundant and consistent, offering a reliable supply of clean energy. Unlike fossil fuels, they do not emit greenhouse gases, making them an environmentally friendly option.

(2)  
Tidal energy, one form of ocean energy, uses the natural rise and fall of ocean tides. This movement can drive turbines and generate electricity. Tidal power plants are typically built near coasts where tidal ranges are significant. Although the initial setup costs are high, the long-term benefits include a stable energy supply and minimal environmental impact. This makes tidal energy a viable alternative to traditional power sources.

(3)  
Wave energy is another method of harnessing ocean power. It captures the energy from surface waves, which can be converted into electricity. Wave energy converters are placed on the ocean's surface or anchored to the seabed. These devices absorb the force of waves and transform it into mechanical energy, which is then converted into electricity. The potential of wave energy is vast, as oceans cover more than 70% of the Earth's surface.

(4)  
Ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) exploits the temperature difference between warmer surface water and colder deep water. This gradient can drive a heat engine to produce electricity. OTEC plants are usually located in tropical regions, where the temperature difference is greatest. The technology is still in development, but it holds the potential for significant contributions to global energy needs, especially in equatorial regions.

(5)  
Despite the potential benefits, there are challenges to widespread adoption of ocean energy. These include high costs, technological limitations, and environmental concerns. However, continued research and investment could overcome these obstacles. By advancing ocean energy technologies, we can diversify our energy sources and reduce dependence on fossil fuels, paving the way for a sustainable future.
