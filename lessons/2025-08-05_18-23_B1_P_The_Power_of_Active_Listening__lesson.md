## Grammar Focus – Present Perfect vs Past Simple Tenses

### Quick Guide

- The Present Perfect tense is used for actions that occurred at an unspecified time and have relevance to the present. Formed with "have/has" + past participle.
- The Past Simple tense describes actions completed at a specific time in the past. Formed with the past form of the verb.

### Usage Notes

- Present Perfect often uses time expressions like "ever," "never," "already," "yet."
- Common mistake: Confusing the specific past time (Past Simple) with unspecific past (Present Perfect).
- Compare: "I have seen that movie" (time not specified) vs. "I saw that movie last week" (specific time).
