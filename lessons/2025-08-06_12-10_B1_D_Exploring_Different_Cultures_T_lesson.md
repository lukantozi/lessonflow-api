## Grammar Focus – Past Simple vs. Present Perfect

- Past Simple is used for actions completed at a specific time in the past.
- Present Perfect is used for actions that have relevance to the present or occurred at an unspecified time.

### Usage Notes

- Past Simple often uses time expressions like "yesterday," "last week," or "in 2010."
- Present Perfect often uses "ever," "never," "just," "already," and "yet."
- Common mistake: Using Past Simple for actions with present relevance (e.g., I saw that movie → I have seen that movie).
