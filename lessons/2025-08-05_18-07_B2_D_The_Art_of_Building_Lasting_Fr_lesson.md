## Reading Material 1 – The Art of Building Lasting Friendships

(1)  
Anna: Hi, Mark. I was thinking about how some friendships last a lifetime while others fade away.  
Mark: That's an interesting thought. I believe it has a lot to do with effort and understanding.  
Anna: True. Do you think it's important to have common interests?  
Mark: Absolutely, but I also think respecting each other's differences is crucial.  
Anna: I agree. What about communication?  
Mark: Open and honest communication is vital. Without it, misunderstandings can arise.  

(2)  
Anna: Have you ever had a friendship that ended because of poor communication?  
Mark: Yes, I have. It taught me the importance of expressing feelings clearly.  
Anna: That's a valuable lesson. How do you maintain your friendships now?  
Mark: I try to be present and attentive. Regular check-ins help a lot.  
Anna: That's a good strategy. Do you think it's important to make time for friends?  
Mark: Definitely. Even a short message can mean a lot.  

(3)  
Anna: What about trust? How important is it in a friendship?  
Mark: Trust is the foundation of any strong friendship. Without it, a friendship can't last.  
Anna: I couldn't agree more. Do you think trust can be rebuilt if broken?  
Mark: It can, but it takes time and effort from both sides.  
Anna: That's true. Have you ever managed to rebuild trust with a friend?  
Mark: Yes, I have, but it required patience and open dialogue.  

(4)  
Anna: Do you think it's necessary to have similar values to maintain a friendship?  
Mark: Not necessarily. Diverse perspectives can enrich a friendship.  
Anna: That's a good point. How do you handle conflicts with friends?  
Mark: I try to address issues calmly and listen to their side of the story.  
Anna: That sounds wise. Do you think avoiding conflict is harmful?  
Mark: Yes, unresolved issues can create distance over time.  

(5)  
Anna: Lastly, do you think it's important to celebrate each other's successes?  
Mark: Definitely. Celebrating together strengthens the bond.  
Anna: I agree. How do you usually celebrate with your friends?  
Mark: We often go out for a meal or simply spend quality time together.  
Anna: That sounds wonderful. Thanks for the chat, Mark.  
Mark: Anytime, Anna. It's always great talking to you.

## Reading Material 2 – Understanding Inflation in Everyday Life

(1)  
Paul: Hey, Sarah. Have you noticed how prices have been rising lately?  
Sarah: Yes, I have. It's due to inflation, isn't it?  
Paul: Exactly. Inflation is when the purchasing power of money decreases.  
Sarah: I see. How does it affect our daily lives?  
Paul: Well, it means we need more money to buy the same goods and services.  

(2)  
Sarah: So, why does inflation happen?  
Paul: It can occur due to various reasons, like increased production costs or higher demand.  
Sarah: That makes sense. How does the government control it?  
Paul: They often use monetary policies, like adjusting interest rates, to manage inflation.  
Sarah: Interesting. Does inflation affect everyone equally?  
Paul: Not really. It can hit low-income families harder, as they spend a larger portion of their income on essentials.  

(3)  
Sarah: Are there any benefits to inflation?  
Paul: Moderate inflation can actually encourage spending and investment.  
Sarah: That's surprising. How so?  
Paul: When prices are expected to rise, people tend to buy sooner rather than later.  
Sarah: I hadn't thought of that. What about wages?  
Paul: Ideally, wages should increase with inflation to maintain living standards.  

(4)  
Sarah: How can individuals protect themselves from inflation?  
Paul: Investing in assets like real estate or stocks can help.  
Sarah: Are there risks involved with those investments?  
Paul: Yes, but diversifying your portfolio can reduce risk.  
Sarah: What about savings?  
Paul: Keeping money in a savings account with a good interest rate can also help.  

(5)  
Sarah: Do you think inflation will continue to rise?  
Paul: It's hard to predict, but economic indicators can give us some clues.  
Sarah: What should we do if it does?  
Paul: Staying informed and adjusting our financial strategies is key.  
Sarah: Thanks for explaining, Paul. It's clearer now.  
Paul: Anytime, Sarah. It's important to understand these things.
