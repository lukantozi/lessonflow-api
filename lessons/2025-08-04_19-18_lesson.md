## Reading Material 1 – Ethical Dilemmas in Everyday Life

(1) Ethical dilemmas are situations where individuals must choose between two or more conflicting moral principles. These situations often arise in everyday life, requiring thoughtful consideration and decision-making. For example, one might face an ethical dilemma when deciding whether to tell a friend a difficult truth or protect their feelings. Such dilemmas challenge individuals to weigh their values and the potential consequences of their actions.

(2) In the workplace, ethical dilemmas can involve situations such as witnessing a colleague engage in unethical behavior. The decision to report this behavior can be challenging, as it may impact relationships and job security. Balancing personal integrity with professional obligations is often at the heart of such dilemmas. Companies that foster ethical cultures can help employees navigate these challenging situations more effectively.

(3) Ethical dilemmas also appear in personal relationships. For instance, one might struggle with the decision to intervene in a friend's personal issues or respect their privacy. These situations require careful consideration of the potential impact on the relationship and the well-being of those involved. Open communication and empathy are essential in resolving such dilemmas.

(4) Technology introduces new ethical dilemmas, such as the use of personal data. Individuals must decide whether to prioritize convenience over privacy. Companies face dilemmas around data security and the ethical use of artificial intelligence. These challenges require updated ethical guidelines and an understanding of the potential risks and benefits of technology.

(5) Society often debates ethical dilemmas in broader contexts, such as environmental responsibility and resource allocation. Decisions about how to balance economic growth with environmental protection can be contentious. Policymakers, businesses, and individuals must collaborate to find sustainable solutions that align with ethical values and long-term goals.
