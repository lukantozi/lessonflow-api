## Reading Material 1 – Navigating Cultural Differences in Social Settings

(1) Understanding cultural norms is essential when interacting in diverse social settings. Each culture has its own unspoken rules about communication, greetings, and personal space. What may be considered polite in one culture could be seen as rude in another. Observing and adapting to these differences can prevent misunderstandings and build stronger relationships. Familiarity with specific customs helps navigate these social complexities with grace and respect.

(2) Language nuances play a critical role in cultural interactions. Idioms, humor, and expressions often don't translate directly, leading to potential confusion. Being aware of these subtleties can help avoid misinterpretations. It's beneficial to ask for clarification rather than assuming meaning. This open approach encourages learning and fosters more meaningful exchanges.

(3) Dress codes are another important aspect of cultural differences. While some cultures prefer formal attire in social settings, others might lean towards casual wear. Understanding these preferences shows respect and can influence first impressions. Researching in advance or asking for guidance from locals can help align with expectations and demonstrate cultural sensitivity.

(4) Dining etiquette varies significantly across cultures. From the use of utensils to table manners, each culture has its own standards. For instance, in some Asian cultures, it's customary to leave some food on the plate, while others see finishing your meal as a sign of appreciation. Being aware of these norms can enhance social interactions and prevent awkward situations during meals.

(5) Gift-giving customs are another area where cultural differences are prominent. The type of gifts, the timing, and the presentation all carry cultural significance. In some cultures, gifts are expected on first meetings, while others reserve them for special occasions. Understanding these traditions ensures that gestures are received in the intended spirit, avoiding potential social faux pas.

## Reading Material 2 – The Science Behind Nutrition and Metabolism

(1) Nutrition science explores how food affects the body and supports health. Our bodies require a balance of macronutrients—carbohydrates, proteins, and fats—and micronutrients like vitamins and minerals. The right mix fuels energy, supports growth, and maintains bodily functions. An imbalance can lead to health issues, highlighting the importance of a varied diet.

(2) Metabolism is the process by which the body converts food into energy. This involves complex biochemical reactions that transform nutrients into fuel. Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the energy used at rest, while activities increase energy needs. Factors such as age, gender, and muscle mass influence metabolism speed and efficiency.

(3) Carbohydrates are a primary energy source, broken down into glucose. This sugar is essential for brain function and physical activity. However, not all carbs are equal. Whole grains and vegetables offer fiber and nutrients, while processed sugars can spike blood sugar levels and lead to energy crashes. Balancing intake ensures sustained energy and health.

(4) Proteins are crucial for repairing tissues and making hormones. They're composed of amino acids, some of which must be obtained through diet. Animal products and legumes provide these building blocks. A protein-rich diet supports recovery and muscle maintenance, especially after exercise. The body prioritizes protein needs over storage, making regular intake vital.

(5) Fats, often misunderstood, are necessary for absorbing fat-soluble vitamins and supporting cell structure. Healthy fats from sources like fish, nuts, and olives should be included in moderation. They provide long-term energy storage and are essential for brain health. Understanding the types of fats helps in making informed dietary choices, balancing necessary intake without excess.
