## Reading Material 1 – The Psychology of First Impressions

(1) First impressions are formed quickly, often within the first few seconds of meeting someone. These initial judgments can be influenced by various factors such as appearance, body language, and even the tone of voice. While these impressions can be powerful, they are not always accurate. People tend to rely on stereotypes and past experiences to fill in the gaps when meeting someone new.

(2) The halo effect is a common phenomenon where a positive impression in one area can influence perceptions in other areas. For example, if someone is perceived as attractive, they might also be assumed to be intelligent and kind. This cognitive bias can lead to skewed perceptions and affect how we interact with others.

(3) On the other hand, the horn effect is the opposite of the halo effect. A negative first impression can overshadow positive attributes. If someone appears unfriendly or disorganized, they might be judged harshly in other aspects as well. This can create barriers in communication and understanding.

(4) First impressions are not set in stone and can change over time. As we get to know someone better, our perceptions can evolve. This is why it's important to remain open-minded and give people a chance to reveal their true selves beyond the initial meeting.

(5) Understanding the psychology behind first impressions can help us become more aware of our biases. By acknowledging these biases, we can work towards forming more accurate and fair judgments. This awareness can improve our personal and professional relationships, leading to more meaningful connections.

## Reading Material 2 – How Technology Impacts Learning

(1) Technology has revolutionized the way we learn, providing access to a vast amount of information at our fingertips. Online courses, educational apps, and virtual classrooms have made learning more accessible and flexible. Students can now learn at their own pace, revisiting materials as needed.

(2) However, the integration of technology in education also presents challenges. The digital divide means that not all students have equal access to technological resources. This can widen the gap between those who have access to technology and those who do not, leading to disparities in educational outcomes.

(3) Another concern is the potential for distraction. With the internet offering endless entertainment, students may find it challenging to focus on their studies. Educators need to find ways to engage students and keep them motivated in a digital environment.

(4) Despite these challenges, technology offers unique opportunities for collaboration and creativity. Students can connect with peers from around the world, working together on projects and sharing ideas. This global interaction can enhance cultural understanding and foster innovation.

(5) As technology continues to evolve, it is crucial for educators to adapt and find a balance between traditional teaching methods and new technological tools. By doing so, they can create a more inclusive and effective learning environment that prepares students for the future.
