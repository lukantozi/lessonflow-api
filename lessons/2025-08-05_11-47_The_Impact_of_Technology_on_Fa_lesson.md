## Reading Material 1 – The Impact of Technology on Family Communication

(1) Technology has become an integral part of our daily lives, significantly impacting how families communicate. With the advent of smartphones and social media, families can stay connected more easily than ever before. However, this constant connectivity can also lead to challenges, such as feeling overwhelmed by the need to be always available.

(2) One of the positive effects of technology on family communication is the ability to maintain relationships across long distances. Video calls and instant messaging allow family members living in different countries to interact in real-time, reducing feelings of isolation. This can strengthen family bonds despite geographical separation.

(3) On the other hand, the frequent use of technology can sometimes hinder face-to-face interactions. Families might find themselves sitting together but engaging with their devices instead of each other. This can lead to a lack of meaningful conversations and decrease the quality of family time.

(4) Another concern is the way technology can affect the communication skills of younger family members. With increased screen time, children and teenagers might struggle with developing important social skills. The reliance on text messaging and social media can limit their ability to express themselves verbally in real-life situations.

(5) Despite these challenges, technology can also be a tool for enhancing family communication. Families can create shared digital spaces, such as group chats or online photo albums, to share experiences and memories. By setting boundaries and encouraging balanced use, technology can become a valuable asset in maintaining healthy family relationships.

## Reading Material 2 – Climate Change Effects on Global Weather Patterns

(1) Climate change is significantly altering global weather patterns, leading to more frequent and severe weather events. Rising temperatures have been linked to increased occurrences of heatwaves, droughts, and wildfires. These extreme conditions can have devastating effects on agriculture, water supply, and human health.

(2) Another consequence of climate change is the intensification of storms and hurricanes. Warmer ocean temperatures contribute to stronger and more destructive storms. This poses a significant threat to coastal communities, which are increasingly vulnerable to flooding and high winds.

(3) Climate change also affects precipitation patterns, resulting in heavier rainfall in some regions and prolonged droughts in others. This uneven distribution of rainfall can lead to water scarcity, affecting both urban and rural areas. It also impacts food production, as crops may fail due to either too much or too little water.

(4) The rising sea levels caused by melting polar ice caps are another major concern. Coastal regions face the risk of submersion, leading to the displacement of populations and loss of habitats. This not only affects human settlements but also threatens biodiversity and marine ecosystems.

(5) Addressing climate change requires global cooperation and significant policy changes. Efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, transition to renewable energy sources, and implement sustainable practices are crucial. By taking collective action, it is possible to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change and protect the planet for future generations.
