## Reading Material 1 – The Ethics of Social Media

(1) Social media platforms have transformed how we communicate, share, and consume information. While they offer unprecedented connectivity, they also raise ethical concerns. Personal data collection and targeted advertising spark debates about privacy. Users often share more than they realize, leaving digital trails that companies analyze for profit. Balancing innovation and privacy remains a challenge for tech firms and society alike.

(2) Misinformation spreads quickly on social media, impacting public opinion and even elections. Algorithms prioritize content that provokes strong reactions, leading to echo chambers where users encounter only views similar to their own. This can deepen divides and discourage critical thinking. Efforts to fact-check and moderate content are ongoing but face challenges due to the sheer volume of online information.

(3) The impact of social media on mental health is another significant concern. While platforms can foster community and support, they can also lead to anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem. The constant comparison with others often highlights unrealistic lifestyles, creating pressure to conform. Researchers are exploring ways to mitigate these effects, such as promoting digital literacy and setting screen-time limits.

(4) Social media's role in activism and social change is a complex issue. On one hand, it provides a powerful tool for raising awareness and organizing movements. Hashtags and viral posts can bring attention to important causes globally. On the other hand, online activism can sometimes lack substance, with individuals engaging in "slacktivism"—showing support online without taking meaningful actions offline.

(5) Finally, the ethical responsibilities of influencers and content creators are under scrutiny. With large followings, they wield significant influence over public perceptions and behaviors. The line between authentic recommendations and paid promotions can blur, leading to potential conflicts of interest. Transparency about partnerships and sponsorships is crucial to maintaining trust with audiences. Social media continues to evolve, and ethical guidelines must evolve with it.

## Reading Material 2 – The Evolution of Transportation

(1) Transportation has evolved dramatically over centuries, from simple carts to advanced electric vehicles. Each innovation has altered how people and goods move, shaping societies and economies. The invention of the wheel was a breakthrough, enabling the creation of various land vehicles. As trade expanded, so did the need for efficient transportation, leading to the development of roads and bridges.

(2) The Industrial Revolution marked a significant shift with the introduction of steam engines. Trains revolutionized travel by offering faster and more reliable long-distance transportation. Railroads connected cities, facilitated commerce, and contributed to urbanization. As steam power gave way to internal combustion engines, automobiles emerged, transforming personal mobility and urban planning.

(3) Air travel began in the early 20th century and quickly became a preferred mode for long distances. Airplanes shrank the world, making international travel accessible to many. Jet engines and larger aircraft increased passenger capacity and reduced travel times. Despite environmental concerns, the aviation industry continues to grow, with a focus on sustainable innovations like biofuels and electric planes.

(4) The digital age introduced new forms of transportation, such as ride-sharing apps and autonomous vehicles. Services like Uber and Lyft have changed how people view car ownership and public transit. Self-driving cars promise to alter traffic patterns and reduce accidents, though they raise questions about safety, regulation, and employment. The integration of technology in transportation remains a field of active exploration.

(5) Public transport systems have also adapted to modern needs, with cities investing in efficient and eco-friendly solutions. High-speed trains, subways, and electric buses aim to reduce congestion and pollution. As urban areas grow, sustainable transportation becomes crucial for quality of life. The evolution of transportation reflects ongoing efforts to balance convenience, cost, and environmental impact.
