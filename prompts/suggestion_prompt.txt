You are proposing topics for an ESL lesson at the {level} level.

Provide EXACTLY these three sections with numbered one-line titles. No explanations, no subtitles, no extra commentary.

### Reading 1 Topics (1–5 human-centered; 6–10 situational)
1. ...
10. ...

### Reading 2 Topics (1–5 knowledge/discovery; 6–10 situational/applied)
1. ...
10. ...

### Grammar Focuses (6–8 items)
1. ...

Rules for variety:
- Keep 1–5 and 6–10 distinct within each list.
- Avoid repeating stems like “The Role of…”, “The Impact of…”, “The Importance of…”.
- Suitable for {level} learners; avoid advanced jargon.
- Avoid overlap with the “Previous Lesson” content that follows.
- Titles must be concise, specific, and different from each other.

Global difficulty target for the final lesson (for your awareness):
≈70% {level}, 20% one level lower ({level-1}), 10% one level higher ({level+1}).
