Reading Material 1 – Work–Life Balance
(1) Balancing work and life is not about counting hours. It is
about energy, focus, and choice. Many people feel busy yet
unfulfilled, because their time is scattered across tasks that do
not match their values. A clear sense of what matters helps set
gentle boundaries. When we include rest and relationships in our
plans, daily pressure feels lighter and effort produces better
results. Clarity about trade-offs turns choices into steady
habits.
(2) Technology makes coordination easier, but it also blurs
limits. Messages arrive late at night, and a quick reply turns
into a half hour of extra work. Some teams agree on quiet hours to
protect recovery time. Others rotate responsibilities so no one is
always on call. Small rules create social trust and reduce hidden
stress in a simple, practical way. Clear, written norms help stop
the creep of constant access and protect true rest. For us
(3) Routines can support balance without being rigid. A short
morning walk, a planned lunch, or a scheduled shut-down ritual
nudges the day in a healthy direction. These anchors allow
flexible choices when problems appear. When a deadline grows
urgent, you adjust. When the rush ends, you return to your
anchors, instead of drifting into constant urgency. After busy
days, review and step back. A pause keeps urgency from turning
into a habit now.
(4) Expectations also shape balance. If a company rewards only
visible overtime, people will stay late even when it adds little
value. If leaders praise sustainable pace and clear priorities,
teams learn to say no respectfully. Families help by sharing
chores and planning together. Balance is a shared project, not a
solo achievement won by willpower alone. Shared expectations
enable balance at home and work; clear priorities protect focus
too.
(5) Over time, balance is less a destination than a practice.
Needs change with seasons, health, and family stages. Checking in
weekly helps spot friction early and prevent burnout. Simple
questions work: What gave me energy? What drained it? What trade-
offs will I accept next week? Regular reflection keeps life
aligned with purpose, even when work stays demanding. Weekly
reviews keep plans honest and guide calm adjustments when routines
slip.
Reading 1 – Comprehension & Discussion Questions
1.Detail: Which factors, besides hours, define balance in
paragraph 1?
2.Explanation: How do “quiet hours” and rotating duties reduce
stress, according to paragraph 2?
3.Cause & Effect: Why do “anchors” make it easier to handle
urgent deadlines in paragraph 3?
4.Discussion: In paragraph 4, what shared expectations would
you design for a healthy team culture, and why?
5.Evaluate: Which weekly check-in questions from paragraph 5
would you keep or change? Defend your choice.
Reading Material 2 – Human Body Systems
(1) The human body is organized into systems that work together to
keep us alive. Each system has organs, tissues, and cells with
specific roles. Coordination matters: muscles move bones, but
nerves signal when to act, and blood brings oxygen and fuel.
Thinking in systems shows why health depends on balance, not one
perfect number or one miracle food. This cooperation is called
integration; when one system struggles, others compensate a while.
(2) The circulatory and respiratory systems form a delivery
network. When you inhale, lungs load oxygen into blood. The heart
pumps that blood to cells, which exchange waste for fresh supply.
During exercise, breathing and pulse rise to match demand.
Training strengthens this response, while illness or pollution can
reduce efficiency and endurance. Altitude lowers oxygen, so the
body makes more red cells; training there can boost performance..
(3) Digestion turns varied meals into usable nutrients. Teeth and
stomach break food into smaller pieces; the small intestine
absorbs sugars, amino acids, and fats. Helpful bacteria in the
large intestine process leftovers and make certain vitamins. Fibre
and water keep movement smooth. A steady, diverse diet supports
these steps more than rare, extreme rules. Regular meals, sleep,
and movement support the system better than strict plans now..
(4) The nervous system senses, decides, and directs action. Nerves
carry signals to muscles, but also to glands that release
hormones. Those hormones join the endocrine system, which adjusts
growth, sleep, and stress responses. The two systems interact
constantly; quick nerve messages start changes, while slower
hormones shape longer trends in the body. Fast nerve signals start
actions; slower hormones adjust baseline and keep the body ready..
(5) Body systems aim for stability, a state called homeostasis.
When temperature rises, you sweat; when glucose drops, hormones
release stored fuel. Feedback loops compare current conditions to
targets and trigger corrections. Disease appears when control
loops fail or are overwhelmed. Healthy routines help the body
adapt and return to balance after strain. Sleep, diet, movement,
and routines support these loops and help the body keep steady..
Reading 2 – Comprehension & Discussion Questions
1.Detail: According to paragraph 1, why is coordination among
systems essential?
2.Explanation: How do the heart and lungs work together during
exercise, based on paragraph 2?
3.Cause & Effect: Why can a steady, diverse diet support
digestion better than extreme rules (paragraph 3)?
4.Discussion: In paragraph 4, what are the different roles of
fast nerve signals and slower hormones in guiding the body?
5.Evaluate: Which daily habits most help homeostasis (paragraph
5) in your opinion, and why?
