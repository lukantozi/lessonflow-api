You are designing a complete English-lesson package for my Polish learners at the {level} level.
Use the previous lesson (provided later) strictly as a structural template only—do not reuse any content, themes, examples, or vocabulary from it.

IMPORTANT: The reading mode (dialogue vs. paragraphs) may change from lesson to lesson.
No matter what style is present in the “Previous Lesson”, you must format **Reading Material 1** and **Reading Material 2** according to the {READING_MODE_BLOCK} instructions for the current lesson.
In other words, if {READING_MODE_BLOCK} specifies numbered paragraphs, do not copy dialogue scenes from the previous lesson, and vice versa.

Follow these steps:

1) Topic & Grammar Selection
Use EXACTLY the Topic 1, Topic 2, and Grammar Focus that I provide above this prompt. Do not substitute or invent alternatives.

2) Generate the Full Lesson

{READING_MODE_BLOCK}

{END_SECTIONS_BLOCK}

## Vocabulary Focus
- Exactly 12 target items.
- Output strictly as bullet lines (no numbering), each on ONE line, using this pattern:
  - word | concise {level} meaning | clear {level} example sentence
- Each line must contain exactly two vertical bars (" | ").
- No tables. No extra commentary.

## Vocabulary Exercises
- At least 5 varied exercises.
- Formatting:
  - Headings: Exercise 1 – Title
  - Try to not to repeat new words if possible in different exercises. 
  - Make sure to match the difficulty to the level chosen
  - Then: 1., 2., 3. numbering; single-line items; a–e options on one line.
  - No tables.

## Grammar Focus – (name of the chosen grammar)
Quick Guide
- Short, precise explanation of form and meaning (2–4 concise lines).
